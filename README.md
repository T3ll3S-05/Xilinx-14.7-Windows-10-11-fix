# Xilinx 14.7 Fix for Windows 10 and 11  

This repository contains a script that resolves most (if not all) issues with Xilinx 14.7 on Windows 10 and 11.  

## Instructions  

### Pre-requisites  

1. **Uninstall any existing Xilinx installation.**  
   - Ensure that the `Xilinx` and `.Xilinx` folders do not exist in the `C:\` directory.  
2. Download the **standard Xilinx 14.7 installer** (not the Windows 10-specific version).  

### Installation Steps  

1. Run the Xilinx installer (`xsetup.exe`).  
2. Before proceeding with the installation, execute the `xilinx_14.7_fix.bat` file as **Administrator**.  
3. Continue with the installation process as usual.  
4. Around 91% progress, the WebTalk process (`xwebtalk.exe`) will be triggered.  
   - The script will automatically terminate this process to prevent the installation from freezing.
   - After that, the script will replace certain DLLs in the `Xilinx` directory.
5. After installation is complete, open **Manage Xilinx Licenses** and install your license file.

## Tips  

- **Unresponsive Terminal:**  
  If the terminal appears stuck, press any key to refresh it.  

- **File Copy Errors:**  
  If the script fails to copy some files, check the `.bat` file for a list of paths that require manual updates.  

- **WebTalk Process Not Terminated:**  
  If the script does not terminate `xwebtalk.exe` automatically, open Task Manager and end the process manually.
